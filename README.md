# Trash Detector

Welcome to my trash detector project! This is a project I created that uses ultralytics YOLOv8 to identify trash in an image so you can make sure to pick it up and throw it away!
Not only will it identify trash, it will also identify if it is recyclable or not, allowing you to make more informed decisions with item disposal!

This was my first computer vision project and it was a lot of fun! Throughout this project I had to learn how to convert a dataset from COCO form to a YOLO form, utilize bash scripts
to do multi-GPU training on a super computer, and build a streamlit app to allow for interactive use!

Here is a video of how my project works!
